Angular 11 is in currently in pre release state. As of now there is no official information regarding Angular 11 release date. 

However our applications can be update to Angular 11 pre release versions.

In this post I will explain the features of Angular 11 version in detail.

## Update to Angular 11 Version

If your application is in Angular 10 and want to update it to Angular 11 you can use following `ng update` command to upgrate to version 11 of Angular.

```
ng update --next
```

Just add `--next` flag as Angular 11 version is in pre release state.

I strongly suggest you to update your app to Angular 10 before upgrading to Angular 11.
[Update to Angular 10](https://www.angularjswiki.com/angular/update-angular-cli-version-ng-update-to-latest-6-7-versions/)

The command will update the app to Angualr 11 or suggest steps to update it to Angular 11.

    We analyzed your package.json, there are some packages to update:

      Name                               Version                  Command to update
     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      @angular/cli                       10.1.2 -> 11.0.0-next.2  ng update @angular/cli --next
      @angular/core                      10.1.2 -> 11.0.0-next.2  ng update @angular/core --next
```

So we need to update Angular cli to the version 11.0.0-next.2 version

```
 ng update @angular/cli@11.0.0-next.2 --force
```

As Angular 11 is in pre release state, its better to add version to the command.

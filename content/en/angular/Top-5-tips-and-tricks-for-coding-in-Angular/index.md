Users of JavaScript frameworks for web development increase by the day. 

Most Programmers prefer to use Angular to build single-page applications. 

The Angular framework is one of the most popular JS frameworks for many reasons. 
The first is that Angular has the tools and design templates to produce efficient apps. 

These applications are efficient because they can run on any platform.

Though Angular poses the best, it cannot be easy to follow through if you do not understand how it works. 

Therefore, to make app development more manageable, you must conversate with all Angular tips.

In this article, you will learn tricks you can use for projects involving coding in Angular. 

These tips may also come in handy when dealing with other development frameworks.

Sit back, read on and learn more.

## 5 Tricks to Improve Your Coding in Angular Skills

Everyone agrees Angular is a project designed to develop complex projects. 

Yet, you can turn it to your advantage by using tricks to develop applications that are correct in a sense.

The best tricks for successful coding in Angular include:

### 1. Keep Syntax Simple

As you develop in Angular, you can’t escape coding to the view. 

Sometimes, this will involve lots of binding, deploying directives, interpolations, and template variability. 

To ensure your coding in Angular is a smooth ride, never go complex on any HTML tag. 

Instead, ensure the app template you develop is direct, easy to understand and read.

Filling HTML tags with too much information will mess up the source code. 

This makes the tags not relevant, as they have unnecessary details. 

To ensure you keep it simple, break down concerns into components. That way, you will develop reusable solutions. 

Strategic methods for each concern will help to avoid creating a complex tag.

Consider plain and clear alternatives to do your tasks. 

You will also make your job as an Angular developer easy.

Always remember this: the HTML has a generic view, even if the project is complex. So there’s never a need to over code.

### 2. Use the Best Methods to Handle Authentication

Regarding authentication, there’s no one size fits for every project. 

The angular framework cannot provide workable collective solutions to these problems. 

So you don’t get frustrated yourself over authentication cases, use individual methods. 

Great solutions depend on the project specifications. 

It also depends on you since you are the solution creator.

Basic principles you can apply to help you approach authentication the right way are:

1. Use a JWT or a similar program to store users’ identities and protect them. Security is an essential aspect of an application. Consider other better alternatives if possible.
2. Double check to ensure that your choice of the JWT or alternative server is secure. They must also recognize the authentication bearer.
3. Use secure guards and interceptors to secure all authorized routes. After securing the routes, add the authentication bearer to HTTP requests.
4. JavaScript security is a top priority for all website applications. First, it would help if you took great care to understand the common [JS security](https://snyk.io/learn/javascript-security/) risks. Then, follow the best authentication practices to solve them.

### 3. Use Services to Handle Side Effects

As you code in Angular, you should reduce common side effects to the least obtainable.

A side effect is a code section not part of the standard coding. Yet, this part gives access to other networks or resources outside the program. 

For example, the common side effect is fetching data from a remote server. Others include HTTP requests, files from local storage, time-based events, and many more.

Tackling these side effects on an individual basis will reduce how complex the project turns out to be. 

It will also ensure the reusability of the service in future scenarios. 

You can develop the services or functions yourself to reduce the side effects. 

Another option is to implement existing functions to solve the problem.

The best way to do this is by using services to handle the side effects peculiar to a specific component. 

Say, for instance, you have a service that takes care of communications via APIs to a remote server. Then, you can inject this service inside the component that needs the solution.

Aside from injecting data into a component, you can build a service-based design and NgRx effects. 

Besides, the best approach is to use the NgRx. But, it requires a sound understanding of what it entails. 

Ensure you can repeat the same procedure within many networks.

### 4. Create Better Imports With Typescript Aliases

When the Angular code begins to grow, you may start to see imports with many dots and forward slashes. 

It can get stressful if you don’t know how many slashes and dots would be enough. 

Sometimes, you may not know the right place for them.

Using a Typescript Compiler simplifies path mapping. It also allows you to import files in a better format. 

You only have to import and define the paths and their basic URL properties. 

You can do this in the compiler option section of the configuration file. 

That way, you can easily resolve challenges by their base URL.

### 5. Detach Logic From Components

To increase the quality of your code, it would be best to separate logic from the components.

Testing components is pretty easy compared to testing the logic. Separating them will help you write better codes, easing reading.

You can use the logic for other components when you detach them. You will also be able to debug and keep track of the components individually. 

Furthermore, getting your async code is easier when you distinguish logic from the respective component.

## Conclusion

Most developers believe that coding in Angular may be more tasking than others. 

Yet, the Angular framework is reliable. 

Angular only needs you to pick up different concepts and paradigms. 

These concepts will help you thrive in coding aside from the primary coding skills.

You will also increase your coding expertise when you code in Angular with a few days of
learning.

The above trick may not cover all tricks you need, but they are enough to ease your use of the Angular framework.

Enjoy Angular, and become a coding pro.

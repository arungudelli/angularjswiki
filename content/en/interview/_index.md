Depending upon your experience you will be asked basic angular interview questions to advanced angular questions.

Before the interview have a look at the list, it might help you to crack the angular interview.

The first stable Angular framework (Angular 2.0) released on 14 September 2016. 

And after that on 23 March 2017, Google team made some breaking changes in Angular framework and released Angular 4.0.0. 

So As of 2021, Most of the developers will have less than 6 years of experience in Angular framework.

This is a big advantage to clear the Angular interview, because resources available for Angular framework are same for all developers around the world.

People who are working on other languages such JavaScript, Java/C#, python etc may face some unexpected questions during the interview because interviewers may have tons of experience in building applications using the mentioned languages.

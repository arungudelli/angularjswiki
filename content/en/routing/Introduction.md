Angular is used to build Single Page Applications(SPA).

In a Single Page Application (SPA), all of your application's functions exist in a single HTML page. 

As users access your application's features, the browser needs to render only the parts that matter to the user, instead of loading a new page. This pattern can significantly improve your application's user experience.

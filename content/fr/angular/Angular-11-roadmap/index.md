Angular 11 version is available now. Before upgrading to Angular 11 version follow the below steps.

1. Upgrade your application to Angular 10 version [Update to Angular 10](https://www.angularjswiki.com/angular/update-angular-cli-version-ng-update-to-latest-6-7-versions/).
2. Then run `ng update` command.

Today i.e., 11-11-2020 Angular 11 version has released. [Angular 11 version is released](https://www.angularjswiki.com/angular/angular-11-released/)

## Update to Angular 11 Version

If you are running your application in version 10 or Angular 11 pre release versions, it's very easy to upgrade your application to Angular 11.

Just run `ng update` it will suggest the necessary steps as shown below.

```
Using package manager: 'npm'

    We analyzed your package.json, there are some packages to update:

      Name                               Version                  Command to update
     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      @angular/cli                       11.0.0-next.2 -> 11.0.0  ng update @angular/cli
      @angular/core                      11.0.0-next.2 -> 11.0.0  ng update @angular/core

    There might be additional packages which don't provide 'ng update' capabilities that are outdated.
    You can update the addition packages by running the update command of your package manager.

```

As I am already using Angular 11.0.0-next.2 version it's suggesting me to run `ng update @angular/cli` and `ng update @angular/core`.

First I ran `ng update @angular/cli`. And it got succeeded.

Please commit your changes before running @angular/core update command.

After running `ng update @angular/core` I got following errors it's failed to upgrate to Angular 11 version.

```

Ã— Migration failed: Incompatible peer dependencies found.
Peer dependency warnings when installing dependencies means that those dependencies might not work correctly together.
You can use the '--force' option to ignore incompatible peer dependencies and instead address these warnings later.
  See "C:\Users\arunkumarg\AppData\Local\Temp\ng-9s5fCf\angular-errors.log" for further details.
```

## Troubleshooting Angular 11 update errors.

I was kind of shocked to see the errors because everytime I update to new version of Angular, I will get errors.

The first step I did to fix the error is to run command with --force flag.

```
ng update @angular/core --force
```

Then it gave one more error `Error: EPERM: operation not permitted`.

Angular 11 is in currently in pre release state. As of now there is no official information regarding Angular 11 release date.

However our applications can be update to Angular 11 pre release versions.

If your application is in Angular 10 and want to update it to Angular 11 you can use following `ng update` command to upgrate to version 11 of Angular.

```
ng update --next
```

Just add `--next` flag as Angular 11 version is in pre release state.

I strongly suggest you to update your app to Angular 10 before upgrading to Angular 11. [Update to Angular 10](https://www.angularjswiki.com/angular/update-angular-cli-version-ng-update-to-latest-6-7-versions/)

The command will update the app to Angualr 11 or suggest steps to update it to Angular 11.

      @angular/core                      10.1.2 -> 11.0.0-next.2  ng update @angular/core --next
```

So we need to update Angular cli to the version 11.0.0-next.2 version

```
 ng update @angular/cli@11.0.0-next.2 --force
```

As Angular 11 is in pre release state, its better to add version to the command.
